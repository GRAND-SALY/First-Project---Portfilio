        What you are about to read is supposed to be my biography but
         it's all just rondom words or <br> it might be some other topic.The first time I actually looked at the code in a browser window was revelatory for <br> Here was the internet in the internet’s own voice! I didn’t understand most of it, but I could pick out snippets <br> of words and phrases that looked familiar. There were a few font names that I recognized, <br> and I understood pixel sizes more or less. The rest of it was alien to me. <br> Here was the language my computer spoke, or so I thought.

            If you’re planning on learning to code, it’s worth th inking through the mechanics of coding. <br> Knowing what exactly is happening when you code, what it means when we <br> say someone is coding, what the difference is between coding and programming, what <br> languages you may end up coding in, and how to get started coding, will help you be a better coder.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            There’s a lot of hype around coding, so let’s start by clarifying what coding isn’t. <br> I mentioned above that when I first saw the source code of a web page, I thought that <br> I was looking at the language my computer spoke. This is a common way of explaining what code is, <br> but it’s not exactly true.
